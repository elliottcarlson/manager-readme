# What is this?
This is my [Manager README](https://matthewnewkirk.com/2017/09/20/share-your-manager-readme/), a document that helps introduce you to my
management style, philosophy, and expectations. The intended audience is primarily anyone who reports in to me, though anyone is free to
read it - as well as provide feedback on it! Please treat it as a reference and promise on how I will conduct myself as a manager, and
what I expect from you.

I urge you to hold me accountable to my promises, and to call out anything that might be missing from this document. Without your
guidance, I will not be able to improve as a manager.

> Disclaimer:
> This document does not apply to anyone else in the company, and solely reflects on my personal management style.

# My Job
As an Engineering Manager, it is my job to:

1. Attract and Retain world-class talent (that's you)
1. Manage and Build well functioning engineering teams
1. Set context

If I fail at any of these - especially anything that puts retaining you at risk - you would be doing me a **huge** favor by letting me know
as soon as possible. I don't expect everyone to stick around forever, however if a departure is potentially due to something we could
have done different, I would appreciate the chance to make things right first.

# How I approach my job
I am not an authoritarian boss. I do not want to micro manage anyone - it's not a good use of my time, or yours.

My teams come first, the customer second, and the company comes third. Obviously I have a responsibility to the company, but without a
well operating, well staffed, and well functioning team, I am unable to live up to those responsibilities. Your success is ultimately my
success - so I will go out of my way to try and make you successful.

I may not always seem to be available, most often due to meetings. Regardless of how busy I am, nothing is more important than the time
I can spend with you. If you need to chat - find time on my calendar - no need to ask. If you can't find time, I will make time. 

# How I expect you to approach your job
I expect you to operate as a [Directly Responsible Individual](https://medium.com/@mmamet/directly-responsible-individuals-f5009f465da4). 

I am not here to tell you how to do your job. I believe you are able to operate as a professional adult, and make smart decisions. This
does not mean that I expect you to do everything on your own - I am here to provide you guidance and mentorship (either through me, or by
finding the people you should be getting it from). Nor do I expect you to know everything - when you need help, I expect you to not
hesitate and ask for it. If you feel you made a mistake, own up to it, we're all human and mistakes happen. Ultimately, I am here to help
you do your job in any way I can.

# Process
I believe that there is a place for process on a team. I need certain processes in place to be able to manage up and out to the rest of
the organization; however I do not believe in process for the sake of process. I know that what works for one team, will not work for
another - and I know that dictating process is not ideal. I will attempt to improve process, but I want to make sure that any changes I
make are beneficial for all parties. If you ever have feedback on process - please let me know - I want the team to operate at its best
at all times, and having a process that makes sense for everyone is critical.

# 1-on-1's
I'm a big fan of 1-on-1's. I believe that these meetings are for you to set the agenda: What would you like to talk about? What’s going
well? What’s bugging you? These don’t need to be about work updates unless you really want to talk about work. If there are things that
I want to ask you, I’ll do it, but this is your time. If I have feedback, I will also provide it during this time.

While I have a preference to meeting for 30 minutes every week, that is not always feasible, nor something that everyone finds beneficial.
By default, I will book us time to meet for 30 minutes every 2 weeks. Additionally, I will have Office Hours scheduled every Tuesday from
12 to 2pm - this time slot is only available to my direct reports. If you want to have an additional 1-on-1 during an off-week, feel free
to book this time with no guilt. As mentioned before, this is not the only time you can reach me - if there is ever something on your mind,
please reach out. If I am busy, I will find time for you.

If you don't like the cadance of our 1-on-1's, please let me know, and I am happy to adjust. The same goes for timing that works best for
you - anything I can do to prevent [unnecessary context switching](https://blog.trello.com/why-context-switching-ruins-productivity). As
mentioned before, 1-on-1's are your time with me - and if you want to skip a 1-on-1, or cut one short, that is completely fine. 

# Feedback
I am a strong believer of [Radical Candor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIh_992Nfes); I want to ensure that you are receiving honest
and actionable feedback on a consistent basis. There should never be a scenario where a performance review, or in the worst case scenario,
a Performance Improvement Plan, is the first time that you hear negative comments or feedback. I will provide you with feedback and
guidance to the best of my ability, and will do my best to ensure that you understand the feedback that I provide to you. I will always
ensure that feedback is given in a private setting.

Feedback should go both ways. I am relying on you to let me know when I am doing something detrimental to my position, our relationship,
or the company. If at any point you feel you have feedback to provide to me, I will listen and internalize the feedback you give me.
Beyond that, I will go one step further and ask you three questions at the end of every 1-on-1 we have:

* "Anything else on your mind?" - Just in case you forgot something!
* "What do you need from me?" - Am I blocking you on anything? Do you have any additional requests?
* "What can I do better?" - This is me opening the conversation to receive feedback from you - please provide it if you have it!

I know that this gets repetitive - but it's very important to me to ask those questions every session.

I will also send an anonymous feedback form on occassion to allow anyone to provide feedback they do not feel comfortable telling me in
person.

# "Where do I stand?"
Part of my job is to track the performance of those who report to me - and obviously provide you with feedback on how to improve.

I categorize people based on one of five particular levels of performance rating (based on standard HR [Performance Rating Scale](https://hr.berkeley.edu/performance/tools/rating-scale)): 

* _Exceptional_ - Performance far exceeds expectations
* _Exceeds expectations_ - Performance consistently exceeds expectations
* _Meets expectations_ - Performance consistently meets expectations
* _Improvement needed_ - Performance did not consistently meet expectations
* _Unsatisfactory_ - Performance was consistently below expectations

It is **really** important to note that a _Meets Expectations_ is not a bad level to be at - I have high expectations of everyone that
reports to me, and meeting those expectations is a great thing! If you ever disagree with my rating of your performance, please bring it
up - I am happy to discuss why I see you at a certain level. 

You will generally know when you are in the _Improvement Needed_ level. 

You will **definitely** know when you are approaching or are at the _Unsatisfactory_ level.

# Things you should know about me
I have personality quirks. We all do. Here are some things that I am both aware of, and that may impact how you work with me:

* I am an [Internal Thinker](https://coachapproachministries.org/thinking-styles/). I will take my time to purposefully choose the words
that I am going to use. I will take my time to rationalize a situation to ensure that I fully grasp what I am commenting on/contributing
to. I am not loud. I have been told that this sometimes feels like I am not engaged or interested in participating (especially in larger
discussions) - but often it means that I am trying to internalize everything before I add my 2 cents. Feel free to call me out if you want
to hear from me.
* I am traditionally a [People Pleaser](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shrink/201210/are-you-people-pleaser). This has acted as a
detriment to me in the past due to taking on too much work when I feasibly could not do this. While I have grown away from this mentality,
I still want to find a way to help everyone. I try my best to not let this impact my ability to do my job, and more importantly, impact
my team. If I do this, please call me out. I have grounded myself extensively over the years, so for the most part this is no longer an
issue - but it does slip through at times.
* According to random personality tests I've taken at random company team building events, I am classified as an 
[INTJ personality](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality). While I find bucketing someone in to a single identifier is as
effective as star signs defining you as an individual, I certainly see traits that match my general personality. Feel free to read up on
that personality type if you want to get some insight in to some broad categorization of who I may or may not be.
